===== Building from source =====
================================

Before compiling the source code, you first need to generate the Makefile using CMake.
NOTE: You need to run `emcmake` to run cmake so that it sets the various
environment variables that are needed for CMake to generate for the em++ compiler.

To configure & build for release, run the following commands:

    `$ emcmake cmake . -Bbuild-release -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`
    `$ cd build-release && make`

It is required that you have the Emscripten SDK installed in your system
and added to your PATH in order to use the tools from the emsdk.
